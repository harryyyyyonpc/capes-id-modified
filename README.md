## Welcome to CAPES ID Generator!

The CAPES ID is an identification system made by the Automation Team in UP Career Assistance Program for Engineering Students to provide IDs to more than 2,000 students in the campus. These were used by the students in event registrations and attendance. As Director for Automations, I modified the program by adding anti-duplication for entries and by making sure that the PDF version of the CAPES ID are sent to the correct student after their information has been registered. This was made using Apps Script.
